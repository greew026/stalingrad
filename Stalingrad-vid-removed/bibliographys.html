          <h2 style="color: #7C7C7B;">Friedrich Paulus</h2>
          <div class="col-md-6"><p> 
		  <h3>"The Sixth Army, true to their oath and conscious of the lofty importance of their mission, have held their position to the last man and the last round for Führer and Fatherland unto the end."</h3>
		  <br>
Born September 23rd, 1890, Breitenau, Germany (now in Austria), died February 1st, 1957, Dresden, East Germany. 
<br>
<br>
Paulus served as a junior officer in World War I and held the rank of captain upon the war’s conclusion. During the interwar years he demonstrated his talents as a staff officer, but superiors questioned his suitability as a field commander. By September 1939, Paulus had 
been promoted to major general.
<br>
<br>
Upon assuming command of the 6th Army, Paulus removed the “Severity Order” issued by Reichenau (General previously in charge of the 6th Army) in October 1941, which called for the execution of Jews and Russian prisoners of war within the Sixth Army’s theatre of operations, but atrocities continued to occur. Commanding some 300,000 troops, Paulus participated in the Second Battle of Kharkiv in May 1942, which resulted in the Soviet offensive conclude with the encirclement and capture of more than 200,000 Red Army troops. During the German summer offensive of 1942, the Sixth Army led the drive on Stalingrad. 
<br>
<br>
In order to prevent the surrender of Paulus, Hitler went to the lengths to promote him to field marshal, to remind him that no German officer of that rank had ever surrendered (implying to him that he should rather commit suicide than surrender). However on 31st January 1943, Paulus surrendered to Soviet forces. Field Marshal Paulus would later testify against Hitler at the Nuremberg trials.

          <h2 style="color: #CC0001;">George Konstantinovitch Zhukov</h2>
          <div class="col-md-6"><p>
		  <h3>"Here they found real war, but they were not ready for it. They were used to easy victories. This deprived them of flexibility on the one hand, of tenacity on the other. For them, war was merely maneuvers. They have neither cavalry nor skiers, their tanks cannot pass over the snow."</h3>
		 <br> 
		  Born on December 1st 1896 in Strelkova, Russia. Born to peasants, he worked in the fields till he was 12, when he got an apprenticeship as a farrier. This was short career as he was conscripted in 1915 to the cavalry, serving in the 106th reserve and the 10th Dragoon Novograd regiments. He was twice awarded the Cross of St.George. 
<br>
<br>
Following the october revolution (1917), he became a member of the bolshevik party and joined the Red Army. During the Russian civil war (1918-1921) he served with the (famed) 1st Cavalry. At the end of the war he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his role in crushing the Tambov (1921) rebellion. In 1933, he was finally given command of a cavalry division.
<br>
<br>
After surviving Stalin's “Great Purges”  (1937-1939), he was selected to command the 1st Mongolian Army Group in 1938. Tasked with preventing Japanese aggression on the border of mongolia and manchuria.  He arrived after the Soviet Victory of Lake Khasan. 
<br>
<br>
On August 20th, he launched his offencive against Japanese forces, pinning them down in the centre while there flanks were overrun by armored units. After encircling the Japanese 23rd Division, proceeded to destroy it, forcing the remainder of Japanese forces to withdraw back across the border. 
<br>
<br>
His leadership was awarded by a promotion to General, and made “Hero Of the Soviet Union” and appointed Chief of General Staff of the Red Army in January 1941. In June when Germany invaded invaded the Soviet Union, opening the conflict between the two nations. As Soviet forces were forced back on all fronts he was (against but felt compelled to do sso) signed “Directive of Peoples' Commissariat of Defense No. 3 ”. Which directed a series of failed counter attacks against german forces to try to slow there drive through Russia. 
<br>
<br>
On July 29, Zhukov was sacked as Chief of General Staff after recommending to Stalin that Kiev be abandoned. Stalin refused and over 600,000 men were captured after the city was encircled by the Germans. in  October, Zhukov was given command of the Soviet forces defending Moscow. Where he immediately ordered for soviet forces in the far east to be brought to aid in the defence of Moscow. In an act of logistical brilliance by quickly bring the forces quickly to moscow, Soviet forces were ready to defend the city and launched a counterattack on december 1st. This counter attack forced the germans back depending on the area 60-150 miles from the city. 
<br>
<br>
With Moscow defended, Zhukov was made deputy commander-in-chief and sent to the southwestern front to take charge of the defense of Stalingrad. While the forces in the city, led by General Vasiliy Chuikov, battled the Germans, Zhukov and General Aleksandr Vasilevsky planned Operation Uranus.
<br>
<br>
A massive counterattack, Operation Uranus was designed to envelop and surround the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. Launched on November 19th, the plan worked as Soviet forces attacked north and south of the city, acting like a pincer to sever german reinforcement or escape. On February 2nd, the surrounded German forces finally surrendered. As operations at Stalingrad were concluding, Zhukov oversaw Operation Spark which opened a route into the besieged city of Leningrad in January 1943.
<br>
<br>
After correctly guessing German intentions, Zhukov advised taking a defensive positions and letting the germans exhaust there forces. These recommendations were accepted and Kursk became one of the great Soviet victories of the war and the largest tank battle in history.
<br>
<br>
Returning to the northern front, Zhukov completely lifted the siege of Leningrad in January 1944, before planning Operation Bagration. Designed to clear Belarus and eastern Poland using a spearhead of tanks and followed by infantry, Bagration was launched on June 22, 1944. A stunning triumph, Zhukov's forces were only forced to stop when their supply lines became too extended. 
<br>
<br>
Spearheading the Soviet thrust into Germany, Zhukov's men defeated the Germans at Oder-Neisse and Seelow Heights before encircling Berlin. After battling to take the city, Zhukov oversaw the signing of one of the Instruments of Surrender in Berlin on May 8, 1945.

          <h2 style="color: #7C7C7B;">Arthur Schmidt</h2>
          <div class="col-md-6"><p>
		  <h3>"... here you come trying to justify the Luftwaffe, that has committed the worst treason, that has ever occurred in German history... An entire army, this wonderful 6th Army, must go to the dogs like this."</h3>
<br>
		  25 October 1895 – 5 November 1987, He was a German army officer from 1914-1943 (when he was captured). 

He is best known for his role in the battle of Stalingrad as the chief of staff of the 6th Army and during the last acts of the battle its ‘commander’ (due to the condition of General Paulus). He played a major role in ensuring that Hitler's order for the army to hold their ground was carried out. While the Red Army encircled Stalingrad. 
<br>
<br>
He was captured after the battle and held prisoner for twelve years before being freed in 1955 by the west German chancellor (Konrad Adenauer) who ijn a visit to Moscow requested the release of all remaining Germand POW’s (prisoners of war) from the second world war.
<br>
<br>
He originally joined the German Army as a one year volunteer in 1948 (when it was believed the first world war would last for only one year), he achieved the rank of lieutenant in 1915. 
<br>
<br>
During the second world war he held various positions, including at times including chief of operation for the 5th Army (from 25th August 1939 to to 12th October 1939) and of the 18th Army (5th November 1939 to 1st OCtober 1940). He was awarded the German Cross (in gold) on the 26th January 1942. 
<br>
<br>
“[He was] a slim, sharp-featured and sharp-tongued staff officer from a Hamburg mercantile family. Schmidt, confident of his own abilities, put many backs up within Sixth Army headquarters, although he also had his supporters. Paulus relied greatly on his judgement, and as a result he played a large, some say an excessive, role in determining the course of events later that year” 
Quote from-Antony Beevor
<br>
<br>
During the battle of Stalingrad he severely underestimated the strength of Soviet forces advancing towards the 6th Army. 
<br>
<br>
During meeting with Luftwaffe officials, Schmidt told 8th Air Corps's commander, (General Martin Fiebig), that Sixth Army needed to be resupplied by air. He was told that "The Luftwaffe doesn't have enough aircraft." Later that day, Schmidt and Paulus held a conference, during which Schmidt "did much of the talking". Schmidt maintained that the army, which would adopt a "hedgehog" defence, must be resupplied, but that the situation was not yet so desperate as there were plenty of horses left that could serve as food.
<br>
<br>
Unlike Paulus, Schmidt was a committed nazi and was seen by officers in the 6th Army as the eyes and ears of the Nazi party within the 6th Army. 
<br>
<br>
He was awarded the Knights Cross on January 6th. 1943.
<br>
<br>
He maintained that the luftwaffe had “committed the worst treason, that has ever occurred in German history” by not resupplying the 6th Army by air in the “kessal” of Stalingrad.
<br>
<br>
After the surrender of the 6th Army’s HQ, he commented aggressively to russians who were checking the luggage during interrogation that “A German Field Marshal does not commit suicide with a pair of scissors.” referencing Paulus. 
<br>
<br>
With the rest of the surrendered German officers he was transferred to Camp 48 at Voikovo. After Voikovo, Schmidt was held in Lubyanka prison. He remained there until 1955.
<br>
<br>
After his release he was bitterly opposed to german officers who who had co-opperated with Soviets in the National Committee for a Free Germany. He died in 1987.

          <h2 style="color: #CC0001;">Vasily Zaytsev</h2>
          <div class="col-md-6"><p>
		  
		  <h3>"The arrival of the Nazi sniper set us a new task, We had to find him, study habits and methods, and patiently await the moment for one, and only one, well-aimed shot."</h3>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  23rd March 1915- 15th December 1991. Was a Soviet sniper and recipient of the “Hero of the Soviet Union”. Before 10th November he had killed 32 Axis Soldiers, in between 10th November and the 17th of December this count stood at 225 Axis Soldiers and officers, additionally 11 enemy snipers at Stalingrad. 
<br>
<br>
Zaytsev was born in Yeleninskoye, and grew up in the Ural Mountains. Where he learnt how to shoot by hunting wolves and deer with his grandfather and brother. His first kill was at 12. 
<br>
<br>
When the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany, Zaytsev was a clerk in the Navy, in Vladivostok. Like many others of his comrades he “Volunteered” to be posted at the front line. He was a chief petty officer in the navy and after the transfer was a senior warrant officer. He was assigned to the 1047th rifle regiment of the 284th “Tomsk” rifle division. Which became part of the 64th Army in Stalingrad on the 17th September 1942.
<br>
<br>
During his activities as a sniper, he would use hights, sewers, rubble and water pipes to conceal his position. After several kills he would switch positions. With his comrade, Nikolai Kulikov, Zaytsev would exercise his “hide and sting tactics”. One of Zaytsev’s common tactics was to cover one large area from three positions, with two men at each point – a sniper and a scout. This tactic, known as the “sixes”, is still in use today and was implemented during the war in Chechnya. 
<br>
<br>
He took part in the battle of Stalingrad until January 1943, when a mortar attack injured him, his eyes were damaged. He was attended to by Vladimir Filatov, who is credited with restoring Zaytsev's sight. On 22 February 1943, Zaytsev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. He then returned to the front and finished the war at the Battle of the Seelow Heights in Germany, with the military rank of captain. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1943. 
<br>
<br>
He died on the 15th of December 1991, ten days before the fall of the soviet union. He was originally buried in Kiev, despite his wishes to be buried in Stalingrad. His wishes were carried out during 2006.
